### Deep Learning based Deforestation Prediction

Given the last ten forest losses (data from weekly recordings of GLAD), we predict possible future losses.
We trained our algorithm on historical data sequences which we extracted from the GLAD database.

#### Data

Our processed data is publicly available in Google Drive

#### Model results

##### Definitions
GT: Ground Truth
Gen: Predictions
Input: Historical Input Sequence

We expect better results given more data and time! But we can already see some structures!
