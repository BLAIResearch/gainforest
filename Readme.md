Take a AI-powered stake against deforestation!

### What are we doing?

tldr; we protect the Amazonas by offering caretakers to take stakes on land tiles of the forest. If its still there next week (or month, year), you get paid out an interest, depending on the likelihood. If not, you lose your stake.

#### Donator
Imagine you want to protect the most endangered places in the Amazonas! Donate money into our smart contract and our AI will use this money to pay interest to farmers, companies and individuals who stake that they will take care of risky tiles of the forest

#### Caretaker
Imagine you are a farmer and you want to cut this part of the forest for your cows. Stop! Our algorithms predict that you will likely cut this part down. Why not stake money on it? The more we think you want to cut the forest, the more interest you can get paid out from donators, when you keep this part of the forest green! Turning deforestation economically nonsensical.
